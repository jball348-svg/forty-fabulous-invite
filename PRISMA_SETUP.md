# Prisma Database Setup - DEPRECATED

> **⚠️ The Prisma database approach has been replaced with Supabase.**
>
> Prisma was causing runtime errors in the Vercel serverless functions due to
> client generation issues and the free Prisma Accelerate database expiring.
>
> **Please follow the instructions in [`DATABASE_SETUP.md`](./DATABASE_SETUP.md)
> to set up Supabase instead.** Supabase is simpler, more reliable, and has a
> generous free tier.
